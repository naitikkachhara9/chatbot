Completion :
Good morning Pauline
	Please see below information from Sergey, He is not available until Wednesday morning at 8am, however is can also remove the wall and tile, which will be needed to perform this service. 
	Good morning, Brenda. based on pictures ,it is looking like vent stack for clean out install is behind tile and drywall , removal of both is needed for access. We can cut open wall and remove few tiles and install clean out with access panel above toilet for future use. Tile man has to install new tile after we done. 
	We can be onsite 8am Wednesday, if it is too complicated with schedule of multiple vendors- we can cut wall and remove tile as we need Wednesday morning.
