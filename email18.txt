Subject : Re: BKS - Homeowner Has Voltage Question About New Washer/Dryer - PV-CAS-594A7E
Body:
Hi Alex - 
I have submitted a request to have the board review this request. In my email chain with them none of them raised any concerns, so hopefully this can be approved quickly. I also mentioned in the ticket I saw on zillow someone in this condominium is selling their unit and has a big washer and dryer which means they likely have this voltage in their place. 
Thanks,
Erika
