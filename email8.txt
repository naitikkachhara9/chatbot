Alex,
We will be onsite between 11am and 12:30pm on Monday, April 3rd. 
Access to units is required. This is so we may conduct alarm device audibility testing within the units. We require a point of contact who will be available by telephone if we need to get a hold of someone on the property.
Thank you,
Autumn

	Please give me the time as well on which you can visit the site and kindly also let us know if the unit access will be required.
	We will speak to board members about their availability.
	Kindly also let us know if anything needs to be informed to Homeowner from your end before scheduling the visit.
