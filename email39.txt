Subject: RE: Brookside Condominium - Damaged NW siding replacement and  NW downspout drains - PV-CAS-5D647F	
Body:
Hi Alex,
Please send over another on site contact for Brookside Condominiums as soon as possible. I have spoke with Bonifacio and it seems like it isn’t possible to get a time to go out and meet. If Harvey is the only on site contact than we will need a description of what needs to be fixed along side pictures.

Dear Aaron 
Thank you for your response.
Before providing you with the contact details of the board member I need to check with the board’s Availability.
And in that case, if you confirm the technician’s availability, it will help me with that.
Kindly let us know if you have any questions. You can reach us at services@propvivo.com <mailto:services@propvivo.com>  or call us at 888-392-3515.
Thanks & Regards,
