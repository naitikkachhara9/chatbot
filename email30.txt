Prompt:
Subject: RE: BKS - Building Envelope Inspection - PV-CAS-BE70F4
	Hi Alex, 
	We opened an area that was actively leaking toward the front of the building at the entrance to the center “courtyard” area. We discovered that a bathtub drain is leaking in either Unit 406 or 407. Would be good to get a plumber out to resolve the situation.
Completion :
Dear Kris,
	Thank you for helping me with the information.
	Please let me once the inspection is completed because the study is going to help us a lot to understand the issues of HOA.
	Kindly let us know if you have any questions. You can reach us at services@propvivo.com <mailto:services@propvivo.com>  or call us at 888-392-3515.
