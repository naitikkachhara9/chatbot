		Hi board members,
		The washer/dryer I currently have in my unit broke, so I am looking to purchase and install a new one. In order to do this I need to have a 240V service brought to my unit to handle the power. Is this something that is allowed in our units?
Hi Erika,
	I’m not aware of why this would be an issue. CCing PropVIVO to see if they have any insight of any cons to this. 
Completion :
Dear Board,
	Do we allow owners to have washers/dryers installed in Units when we have Laundry Room?
	If the Board decides to allow owners to install we should have our deductible increased to $25000 per incident.
	We will wait for the board’s response before replying to erica.
	She just needs to raise an ARC request and the board needs to approve that.
		Thanks,
		Erika
