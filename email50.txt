Subject: Re: BKS - Request a plumber urgently to investigate #103 drainage - PV-CAS-1ACB7E
Body:
			Alex,
			Best Plumbing company contacted me today to confirm owner's availability before dispatching the technician to do a camera check to provide a thorough assessment of the plumbing situation in SW homes. 
			Please confirm my understanding: that the Best Plumbing and Kingco contractor appointments were to be scheduled for same date and time to inform the minimal amount of sheetrock removal
			Thank you,
			Pauline 
Completion :
Dear Pauline
			 Yes, your understanding is correct.
			 The king contractor is only left with providing us with the time of arrival, and the best plumber told me that they will schedule the work at our convenience, but they are going to charge for the inspection, and the cost for that will be $99.00, including taxes.
			 The king contractor will work in units 202 and 102, and Best Plumbing will provide the camera check for units 102 and 103.
			 I sent an email to all the board members for the approval of the $99.00 inspection charges, and we need the decision by Monday because the best plumbing informed us today about the charge and we need to provide them with the confirmation by Monday.
			Thanks
