Prompt:
Subject: HOA dues - unit 402
Body:
	Hi there,
	Can you tell me why my dues weren’t automatically paid? I thought there wasn’t anything I needed to do if I had autopay already set up.

	Hello Brenden,
	Sorry for the inconvenience. The ACH batch of January 1 and 2 is still under process and we have reached out to the banking partner to resolve the same. Expected resolution by January 6.
