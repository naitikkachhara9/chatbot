Hi Brendan,
We shouldnâ€™t need additional quotes for this. Brimstone has been the vendor for this inspection and they know where all the fire extinguishers are as well as the fire alarm. The works is not large enough to spend time getting additional quote and educating a new vendor.
Thanks,
Harvey
