Hi PropVIVO, 
What's the latest on this? Pauline mentioned there was some reference to a sinkhole under the building. I'm not sure what to make of that but whoever does this testing should check for that as well. 
I'd also like to be there for this inspection. Can this be done during a weekend? 
Completion :
Thank you for sharing that, Pauline. That looks a little different than what we're shooting for so let's still have PropVIVO do some digging for now.
